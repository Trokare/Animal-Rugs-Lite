Animal Rugs Lite
This mod is inspired and borrow graphics from TheGoofyOne's Area Rugs 2.0 (https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1988111624) and adds a bunch of 3x3 animal rugs with different styles to RimWorld:

- Thrumbo Rug(Animalist, Totemic, Rustic and Morbid)
- Grizzly Bear Rug(Animalist)
- Polar Bear Rug(Animalist)
- Megasloth Rug(Totemic)
- Muffalo Rug(Rustic)
- Warg Rug(Morbid)

NOTES/CHANGES to VANILLA:

This mod is a lot lighter than the original Area Rugs 2.0 mod, it's based on the rustic rugs created for Ideology and they are created directly from the leather with a bit of cloth to keep it simple.

The only exception is the Thrumbo Rug who require the Thrumbo's horn too because it's a part of the rug.

I tried a bit to group the rugs in a single drop down to take less space on the menu or to make them work with base Rimworld but I wasn't able to.

Add/Remove notes: Safe to add but don't remove it if you have rugs produced by this mod in your save, destroy them before.

Version 1.0 - Released on steam. Source code available at https://github.com/Trokare/Animal-Rugs-Lite
